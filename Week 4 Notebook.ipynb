This is its first physical establishment in the Asian island country. In the planning phase, the management has considered two potential locations, namely, Sentosa Island or Marina Bay Area. Sentosa is a resort island located at the south of Singapore and connected to the main island via a bridge. This island is mostly frequented by families on holiday. Marina Bay Area is the central business district of the city and it is also closely located to many other attractions in the city. \n\nThe primary customer group for IHC are tourists looking for leisure activities as well as new experiences in difference countries. IHC is also one of the world's premium hotel brands which all of its properties rated five stars. Therefore, one of the main consideration of for the location is its proximirty to attarctions nearby. Given Singapore is a small island nation and both locations are easily accessible, the management has approached us to determine which location would be a better option to set up IHC's first Hotel in Singapore."
